I have decided that making a new form exceeds the scope of the work and has many compatibility issues.
Instead I will focus on reformatting the existing code to make it cleaner and more maintainable.
As well as fixing the issues with the code that I have identified.
To DO this I will:
 - Make a macro that will export all the current code into a file (done)
 - Use the extracted code to build a framework for the existing subsystems, classes and modules.
  Enquiry -> Quote -> Jobs
  Jobs -> Job Cards -> WIP Reports
  Contracts (Job Templates)
  Search(Finds anything in the system)
 - this will also help with finding unused code and dead code.
 - I will then build a new framework for the new code that will be more modular and easier to maintain.
 - Issues like reports that use weird formatting etc. will be fixed in the new code.
 - The new code must be compatible with both 32 and 64 bit excel
 - The new code must use the same directory structure as the old code.
    - There are tens of thousands of files stored in the old structure.
    - the only goals are to make the interface code cleaner and more maintainable.
    - and then remap the existing forms to use the new functions in the code.
