# Create Forms Manually - Avoid Import Issues

The .frm file format is causing issues. Let's create the forms manually instead:

## Method 1: Create UserForm Manually

### Step 1: Create New UserForm
1. Open VBA Editor (`Alt + F11`)
2. Right-click your project → **Insert** → **UserForm**
3. A new UserForm1 will appear

### Step 2: Rename the Form
1. In Properties window, change **(Name)** to `TestForm`
2. Change **Caption** to `Test Form`

### Step 3: Add This Code
Double-click the form and paste this code:

```vb
Private Sub UserForm_Click()
    MsgBox "Hello World!"
End Sub
```

### Step 4: Test
Press `F5` or run `TestForm.Show` from Immediate Window

## Method 2: Export/Import a Working Form

### Create a working form first:
1. Insert new UserForm manually
2. Add the simple code above
3. **Export** it: Right-click form → Export File
4. Now **Import** that exported file

This creates a proper .frm file with correct encoding.

## Method 3: Use Code-Only Approach

Skip forms entirely and create a simple module:

```vb
' TestModule.bas
Sub TestInterface()
    Dim searchTerm As String
    searchTerm = InputBox("Enter search term:", "PCS Search")

    If Len(searchTerm) > 0 Then
        ' Call search function
        TestSearch searchTerm
    End If
End Sub

Sub TestSearch(term As String)
    MsgBox "Searching for: " & term & vbCrLf & "This would show results in a real implementation."
End Sub
```

## Recommendation

Try **Method 1** first - create the UserForm manually in Excel rather than importing .frm files. This avoids the file format/encoding issues entirely.

Once you have a working form created manually, you can export it to see the proper .frm file format for future reference.
